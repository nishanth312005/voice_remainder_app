🎤 Voice-Controlled Reminder System
The Voice-Controlled Reminder System is an intelligent task management application designed to simplify daily routines through natural voice interaction. Unlike traditional reminder applications that rely heavily on manual input, this system enables users to create, manage, and receive reminders completely hands-free using speech recognition, natural language processing (NLP), and text-to-speech technologies.

Acting as a digital personal assistant, the application supports personal, academic, and professional task management while emphasizing accessibility, security, and reliability.

🎯 Project Objectives
- Enable hands-free task management using voice commands  
- Provide natural interaction through Speech-to-Text (STT) and Text-to-Speech (TTS)
- Offer personalized task management with secure authentication
- Ensure reliable reminders using dual audio and visual notifications
- Support recurring reminders and flexible scheduling
- Enable cloud-based synchronization across multiple devices
- Improve accessibility for elderly and visually impaired users
- Maintain data security and privacy with encryption

🚀 Proposed System
The proposed system overcomes these limitations by offering an intelligent, voice-driven reminder platform with:

- Natural voice command processing using NLP
- Text-to-Speech confirmation and reminders
- Categorized task management (To-Do, In Progress, Done, Deleted)
- Flexible scheduling (daily, weekly, alternate days, custom intervals)
- Cloud synchronization with offline support
- End-to-end encrypted data storage
- Inclusive design for accessibility

 ✅ Advantages
- Hands-free operation using voice commands  
- Interactive audio and visual feedback  
- Structured task categorization  
- Advanced recurring reminder support  
- Reliable dual notifications
